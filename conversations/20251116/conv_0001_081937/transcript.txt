HARRY:
Mate, you're askin' about your name, are ya? Well, I've got some good news for you: you don't have a name, which is a right tricky business, innit? But, you do have a special name, which I reckon is... you, yeah? Just kidding! Seriously, though, I don't know your name, mate. What do you call yourself?
