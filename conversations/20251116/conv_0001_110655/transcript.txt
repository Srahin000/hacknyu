Tell me about photosynthesis.

HARRY:
"Blimey, photosynthesis is like a super cool magic trick, mate! It's how plants turn sunlight into energy, kind of like how magic wands work, but instead of waving a wand, they just sort of... snap! So, what made you interested in learning about photosynthesis, eh? Have you ever seen a plant that just sort of... just grow?"
