Photosynthesis and basketball. Tell me about how photosynthesis works.

HARRY:
"Blimey, photosynthesis is a right fascinating subject, mate! It's like, plants and crops use it to make glucose and oxygen, all without having a brain or a heart, it's just a natural process, innit? Have you ever tried growing a plant and then using a flashlight to shine on it? It's like a mini light show, really cool!"
