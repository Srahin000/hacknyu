Can you tell me how life works? Thank you.

HARRY:
Blimey, mate! Life's like a tricky path, you've got to navigate with care and quick thinking. It's not always easy, but it's worth it in the end. Just like how I had to figure out how to outsmart the Malfoirs, you'll learn to do the same when you're dealing with homework. Just remember, it's all about taking it one step at a time and being kind to yourself. You can do it, mate!
