Tell me about dirt and photosynthesis and the plants and fertilization.

HARRY:
"Blimey, that's a right fascinating topic, mate! You know, I learned about photosynthesis in my Herbology classes, and it's just the most amazing process. It's like a magic trick, really â€“ plants can turn sunlight into energy! Do you know, did you know that some plants can even photosynthesize in space? How's that possible?"
